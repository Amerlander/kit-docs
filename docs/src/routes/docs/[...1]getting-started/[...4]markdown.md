# Markdown

Markdown files are just Svelte components so you can use them to create layouts `__layout.md`,
pages `routes/docs/page.md`, or components (e.g., breaking down a large Markdown file into
multiple components).

```svelte title=Component.md
<script>
import Walkthrough from './Walkthrough.md';
</script>

# Quickstart

...

## Walkthrough

<Walkthrough />
```

The only difference between a Markdown file and Svelte component is that you can use top-level
tags such as `<script>`, `<script context="module">`, and `<style>` multiple times.

:::yes
The following is valid because KitDocs will merge top-level tags:
:::

```svelte title=Component.md
<script>
// ...
</script>

<script>
// ...
</script>
```

## Global Components

You can create Svelte components that are global, meaning they're imported into every single
Markdown file. In addition, global components are automatically mapped to Markdown containers and
you can pass in props and dynamic slot elements. Here's how:

```
src
└─ lib
   └─ components
      └─ markdown
         ├─ Button.svelte
```

Now, inside your markdown files you can use `<Button>` like so:

```svelte title=Component.md

<!-- Use the component as-is. -->
<Button />

<!-- Or, use a markdown container. -->
:::button propA="valueA"|propB=10
Default slot content here.
:::

<!-- You can pass in dynamic slot elements! -->
:::button (tag=h1&slot=title)=Title
Default slot content here.
:::
```
